                The "Lateral Thinking Game" is an interactive web application that challenges users to solve puzzles based on lateral thinking. Players uncover the story behind each puzzle by asking a series of "yes" or "no" questions. Using a language model, the app analyzes the users' questions and provides answers, gradually guiding them toward the key clues needed to solve the puzzle.
