## üöÄ Project Setup
### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Docker
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Python (for backend)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone and Open the Project**
   - Clone the repository and open the project folder in your preferred editor.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Create a `var.env` file in the `backend` directory:
      ```env
      OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
      ```

3. **Start the Application with Docker Compose**
   - Ensure Docker is running on your system.
   - From the project root directory, run:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```
   - This command will:
     - Build and start the backend service (FastAPI)
     - Build and start the frontend service (React)
     - Start MongoDB database
     - Set up networking between all services

4. **Access the Application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8001

5. **Stop the Application**
   - To stop all services:
      ```bash
      docker-compose down
      ```

### Additional Notes
- Ensure Docker is running before starting the application.
